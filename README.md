##### What is this

This is an opportunity to test our decision processes as a group. With such a
simple document concept, we can easly understand how well or badly are we able
to converge on a shared content.

The result will also be quite an useful web page.

##### The idea

To collect height lines, representing the most important topics we know about
Infovis. No more than eight. Wen we want to include a new line, we must remove
an existing one.

The naming is taken from the idea of eight cardinal points on a map.
Suggestions for alternative metaphores are welcome.

A point can be a technology (language or framework), person, event, book,
concept, website. To summarize, it can be whatever can be named or descripted.

##### Unordered 

The list is unordered. Truly unordered. How can be unordered a list which has a
layout, and thus a position for each element, that gets a different importance
according to the reader's culture?

Well, it's randomly shuffled at each page load.
